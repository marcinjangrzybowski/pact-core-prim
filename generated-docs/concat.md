# concat

## Basic syntax

The `concat` function in Pact programming language takes a list of strings (`str-list`) and joins them together into a single string. 

Here is the basic syntax of `concat` function:

```pact
(concat str-list)
```

In this syntax, `str-list` is a list of strings you want to combine together. It's important to note that `str-list` should be of data type `list [string]`, i.e., a list that contains elements of type `string`.

Here's an example syntax demonstrating how to use `concat`:

```pact
(concat ["Hello" " " "World"])
```

In this example, the `concat` function takes a list of strings `["Hello" " " "World"]` and joins them together to return the string "Hello World".

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| str-list | [string] | Specifies the list of strings that you want to concatenate. The function takes each string in the list and concatenates them in order, returning the resulting string. |


## Prerequisites

N/A

## 
In this section, detail what your function returns. Describe the type and purpose of the returned value, and explain in what context this return value would be useful. 

Remember, this section should not be left empty - if the function does not return anything, clearly state that this is the case.

## Examples

The `concat` function in Pact is used to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. 

Consider the following examples:

```pact
(concat ["Hello" " " "world"])
```
This will output: `"Hello world"` 

Here is another example where `concat` function is used with `map` function:

```pact
(concat (map (+ " ") (str-to-list "abcd")))
```
This will output: `" a b c d"` 

And another example:

```pact
(concat ["k" "d" "a"])
```
This will output: `"kda"` 

These examples illustrate the capability of `concat` function to join together multiple strings from a list into a single string.

## Options

N/A

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.
