# enforce-keyset

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| guard | guard | It is an identity-specific guard returned by `read-keyset`. The function will execute this guard to enforce desired predicate logic.|
| keysetname | string | The function will attempt to execute the keyset with this name defined earlier in the code.|

## Prerequisites

To use the `enforce-keyset` function, you should have a defined keyset or guard you wish to enforce when calling the function. The keyset name should be defined as a `string` and the guard should be derives from the `guard` data type. Definitions are usually set at the start of the function execution. It's also recommended to have a clear understanding of the logic the guard or keyset enforces for effective use of `enforce-keyset`.

## Return values

The `enforce-keyset` function does not have a return value itself. However, it throws an exception if the guard condition fails or if the specified keyset is not authorized. Thus, a successful completion of the function indicates that the enforced keyset or guard is valid and authorized, otherwise, it halts the execution of the transaction.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the use of the `enforce-keyset` function.

The `enforce-keyset` function enforcing an admin keyset:

```pact
(enforce-keyset 'admin-keyset)
```

The `enforce-keyset` function operating with a specified keyset:

```pact
(defcap OPERATE ()
  (enforce-keyset 'operate-keyset))
```

The `enforce-keyset` function with a row guard:

```pact
(enforce-keyset row-guard)
```

The `enforce-keyset` function in a user-defined capability:

```pact
(defcap FUND_USER ()
  (enforce-keyset 'fund-keyset))
```

The `enforce-keyset` function with keyset defined in a constant:

```pact
(defconst FUND_KEYSET (read-keyset 'fund-keyset))

(defcap FUND_USER ()
  (enforce-keyset FUND_KEYSET))
```

## Options

N/A

## Property validation

The `enforce-keyset` function is primarily used to enforce the usage of a particular keyset passed as an argument. This function validates if the keyset or guard in the form of a user-defined string variable is properly defined and is available for usage within the pact.

Any malformed or non-existent keyset name passed as an argument, or a user-guard that does not return true, would result in the function throwing an error. 

Hence the primary responsibility of `enforce-keyset` is to ensure that the provided argument is a valid keyset name, or a guard that meets the required invariant properties. If this validation fails, the function will consequently fail helping you ensure the property and accessibility constraints of your code.

In this section, discuss any unintuitive behavior, potential pitfalls, or common mistakes to avoid while using your function. Make sure to present this information in a clear and concise manner to help your users avoid these issues. If there are no known gotchas associated with your function, respond with 'N/A'.
