## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## 
In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

## 
If your function needs any prerequisites to run successfully, describe them here. If there are no prerequisites, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, detail what your function returns. Describe the type and purpose of the returned value, and explain in what context this return value would be useful. 

Remember, this section should not be left empty - if the function does not return anything, clearly state that this is the case.

## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## Gotchas

While using the `keylog` function, please note the following points:

1. Type of arguments: Make sure to provide the right types of arguments to the function. `keylog` expects the first argument to be a table of objects, the second argument as a string type key, and the third argument as an integer type transaction ID. Providing different data types may lead to unexpected errors or results.

2. Temporal Ordering: The function only considers updates to the provided key in transactions at or after the given transaction ID (TXID). Any updates before the TXID will not be included in the output.

3. Data returned: The returned data is a list of objects indexed by transaction ID. Misinterpretation of the output schema can lead to errors in further data manipulations.

4. Key Availability: If the key provided doesn't exist in the table, `keylog` will fail. Make sure that the key is already defined within the table.

5. Data Consistency: Being a function that retrieves update logs, consistency of results between different invocations isn't guaranteed for `keylog`. As underlying data changes, so will the functionâ€™s return values.
