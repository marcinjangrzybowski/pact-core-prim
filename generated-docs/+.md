# +

## Basic syntax

The `+` function in Pact is used to perform an addition operation on two numbers. 

For the basic syntax, you simply use `+` followed by the numbers you wish to add. Each of the numeric arguments must be separated by space. 

Here is the syntax:

```pact
(+ number1 number2)
```

Each of the arguments in the above syntax is defined as follows:

- `number1`: This is the first number operand. 
- `number2`: This is the second number operand. 

Note: The `+` function works with both integers and decimals.

Here is an example:

```pact
(+ 15.5 20)  ;; Returns 35.5
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | decimal | Specifies the first value to be added |
| b | decimal | Specifies the second value to be added | 
Please note that both arguments `a` and `b` should be of decimal type. The `+` function returns a decimal which is the result of `a` and `b` added together.

## Prerequisites

N/A

## Return values

The `+` function returns the sum of the input numbers. The return value is of type `number`. This function is useful in scenarios where arithmetic addition operations are required, such as incrementing loop counters, adding balance amounts, or other mathematical computations. The sum is calculated in the order the numbers are passed in, i.e., from left to right.

## Examples

The `+` function in pact allows for the addition of two numbers. Here are some examples of how the `+` function can be used:

Adding two integers:

```pact
(+ 3 4)
7
```

Adding two real numbers:

```pact
(+ 3.5 4.1)
7.6
```

Adding value from a variable:

```pact
(let ((x 5))
  (+ x 3))
8
```

Adding value from a column in a table:

```pact
(defschema coin-schema 
  "Schema for a coin entity."
  (balance:integer))

(deftable coin-table:{coin-schema})

(update coin-table "account-1" 
  { "balance": (+ (at 'balance (read coin-table "account-1")) 50) })
```
In this last example, we first defined a schema and a table with a column `balance`. And using the `+`, we've added 50 to the existing balance of the account with the name "account-1". After running this update, the new balance of "account-1" in `coin-table` will be the old balance plus 50.

The `+` function operates on numerical values only. Attempting to add non-numerical values, like strings or lists, will result in a type error. Also, unlike in some programming languages, addition of floating-point numbers doesn't automatically convert to an integer.

When using `+` with variables, pay attention to variable types and ensure they are numerical. Undefined or null variables can't be used in addition and may cause runtime errors. 

Also, it doesn't handle overflow or underflow conditions. When adding very large numbers, be aware that you may exceed the maximum representable number, which will lead to unpredictable results.

Always ensure to perform necessary checks and handle exceptions to minimize runtime errors.
