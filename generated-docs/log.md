# log

## Basic syntax

To calculate the logarithm base `b` of a number `x` using the `log` function in Pact, use the following syntax:

```pact
(log *b*:*a* *x*:*a*)
```

In the function, replace `*b*` and `*x*` with the base and the number for which you want to find the logarithm, respectively. Both `*b*` and `*x*` should be either of type `integer` or `decimal`.

Here's an example:

```pact
(log 2 256)
```
This will return the logarithm base 2 of 256, which is 8.

If `b` is integer and `x` is decimal or vice versa, the function will return a decimal.

```pact
(log 2.5 10)
```
The above example will return the logarithm base 2.5 of 10 as a decimal.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| b | integer or decimal | The base of the logarithm. |
| x | integer or decimal | The number the logarithm is applied to. |

## Return values

The `log` function returns the logarithm of the second argument with the first argument as the base. The return value will always be of type `decimal`. This is useful in contexts where logarithmic calculations are needed, for example in some mathematical, scientific, or statistical computations. It can also be used in algorithms that involve logarithmic time complexity.  

Please note that if either of the input arguments is a negative number or if the base is 1, the function will return a NaN (Not a Number) because these are invalid operations in the logarithmic context.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the `log` function in use:

```pact
(log 10 1000)
```
This will give the logarithm of 1000 to the base of 10, which gives us 3. 

```pact
(log 2 256)
```
This will give the logarithm of 256 to the base of 2, which gives us 8. 

Note that the logarithm can be calculated for any base and any positive number. The base and the number can be decimal or integer but the return value will always be a decimal.

## Property validation

The `log` function in the Pact programming language supports use in both invariants and properties. This is an important property for ensuring correctness of smart contracts. An invariant is a condition that can be relied upon to be true during the execution of a smart contract. In the case of property testing, the `log` function can be used for defining properties that are then checked against test data. If the property returns 'false' for any piece of data, it indicates a problem in the code that needs to be resolved. 

Please note that the `log` function accepts arguments of type integer and decimal. The function will return an error when it encounters a different data type or when the base is less than or equal to zero, or when the number to be logged is less than zero. It's essential to validate these properties before executing the logarithmic function to ensure proper function behavior and avoid runtime errors. These validations safeguard the smart contract from invalid operations and state changes. This type of validation is crucial for ensuring trust and correctness in the blockchain environment. 

Remember that property validations are not meant to replace full-fledged test cases. They serve as additional checks that run during the execution of the contract, complementing the tests to catch errors and inconsistencies. 

It's worth noting that invalid use of the `log` function (for example, providing an incorrect base or trying to compute the logarithm of a negative number) will not necessarily result in a contract failure. Rather, it returns an error message detailing the issue. This decision makes the `log` function safer to use and allows better error handling and failure recovery. 

In summary, the `log` function has built-in property validation for argument types and values, and supports being used in invariants and properties. This adds to code safety and correctness in the functional programming environment of Pact.
