# fold

## Basic syntax

The `fold` function iteratively reduces a list by applying a function to the last result and the current element, starting from an initial value.

Here is the basic syntax:

```pact
(fold *app*:function *init*:a [list]:b) -> a
```

Where:
- *app* is the function to apply. The function should take two arguments: the accumulated result and the current list element.
- *init* is the initial value to start with. This would also be the final result if the list is empty.
- *list* is the list to reduce.

For example, this usage of `fold` will sum up the elements in a list:

```pact
(fold (+) 0 [100 10 5])
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| f | function | A function that takes two parameters: an accumulated value (of any type) and an element from the list. This function will be applied to each element of the list in turn, along with the result of the previous function application. |
| a | any | The initial value for the accumulation, which can be of any type. This value will be used as the accumulated value for the first application of the function f. |
| bs | list | The list of elements that will be folded. Each element in this list will be passed to the function f, along with the accumulated value resulting from the last function application. |

## Prerequisites

Before using the `fold` function, ensure that you have defined or imported a function that will be passed as the first argument "app". This function should accept two arguments, one of the type 'a' (the same type as "init") and one of type 'b' (the same type as elements in the "list").

You will also need a list collection of one or several items of type 'b'. 

Lastly, you require an initial value of type 'a'. This will serve as the starting value for the folding application. 

These are crucial for the `fold` function to execute without error. 

In terms of underlying knowledge, understanding of functional programming concepts like Higher Order Functions and how fold (also known as reduce) works in other programming languages would be beneficial for writing the "app" function and using `fold`.

## Return values

The `fold` function returns a value resulting from iteratively applying the function to each element and the previous result of the list. The output will be of the same type as the initial provided value. This output value signifies the accumulated consequence of the supplied operation (the function) performed on each element of the list, starting from the initial value, and can be useful in various contexts where an aggregation of values in a list is needed. For example, if the operation is addition and the list contains numerical values, the `fold` function would provide the sum of these values.


## Examples

Here are some examples that demonstrate how to use the `fold` function:

```pact
(fold (+) 0 [100 10 5])
```
In this example, the `fold` function is used to add all the elements of the list `[100 10 5]` starting with an initial value of `0`. The resulting output would be `115`.

```pact
(fold (*) 1 [2 3 4])
```
Similarly, this example demonstrates how `fold` can be used for multiplication. Here, the `fold` function multiplies all the elements of the list `[2, 3, 4]` starting with an initial value of `1`. The resulting output would be `24`.

```pact
(fold (-) 100 [20 10 5])
```
Finally, this examples shows how `fold` can be used for subtraction. The `fold` function subtracts all the elements of the list `[20 10 5]` from an initial value of `100`. The resulting output would be `65`.

Remember that the function given to `fold` as the first argument must be a binary function that takes two arguments. The first argument given to this function during execution will be the accumulator (the result of the previous function call or the initial value), and the second will be the current element of the list.

## Property validation

In the context of property validation, `fold` can be used to validate if an entire list satisfies certain conditions or requirements. This can be achieved by creating a predicate function that assesses each element against the condition. 

If the condition holds true for all elements, the `fold` function would return a value confirming this. On the contrary, if any of the elements fails the condition, `fold` would return a value indicating an error or a failure.

Please note that the specific outcome of the `fold` operation depends on the predicate function used. The predicate function should be designed in such a way that it correctly represents the required condition and returns meaningful values. 

Also, the type for both the predicate function results and the list elements should be the same to ensure accurate property testing and validation.
