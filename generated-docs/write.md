# write

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## 
In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

## 
If your function needs any prerequisites to run successfully, describe them here. If there are no prerequisites, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, detail what your function returns. Describe the type and purpose of the returned value, and explain in what context this return value would be useful. 

Remember, this section should not be left empty - if the function does not return anything, clearly state that this is the case.

## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## Gotchas

When using the `write` function, users should keep the following points in mind:

1. The `write` function will overwrite any existing data for the given table and key. If the intention is to simply update certain fields of the row, make sure to read the current value, modify the desired fields, and then write the entire object back.

2. The `write` function does not check for the existence of the key prior to write operations. If you want to ensure a key does not already exist in the table before writing, you would need to use a `read` operation first.

3. If the key does not exist in the table, the `write` function will create a new row. It is essential to use the correct and precise key to avoid unintentional writes in the table.

4. Data type must match the schema of the table for the `write` function to be successful. Writing data with an incorrect data type will result in a pact error.

5. It's critical to remember that the write operation in Pact is 'all or nothing'. If execution fails for any reason, all changes within the transaction are rolled back. This includes writes. 

6. Since the `write` function returns a string, not a boolean, you should not use the result of `write` in conditional expressions. Instead, write directly to the database and use `enforce` to assert conditions.

Please refer to the examples throughout the documentation to ensure you are using the `write` function properly.
