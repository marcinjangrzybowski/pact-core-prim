# !=

## Basic syntax

Here is the 'Basic syntax' for the `!=` function in Pact.

```pact
(!= *x*:any *y*:any)
```

The `!=` function in Pact takes two arguments of any data type, and returns a Boolean value. It checks if the two values are not equal to each other, and returns `true` if they are not equal, and `false` otherwise.

Here's an example usage with integer values:
```pact
(!= 1 2)
```
In this case, since 1 is not equal to 2, the result would be `true`.

You can also use `!=` function with other data types like string. Here's an example usage with string values:
```pact
(!= "hello" "goodbye")
```
In this case, since "hello" is not equal to "goodbye", the result would be `true`.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | integer, string, time, decimal, bool, object, list, keyset, or guard | The first value to compare |
| y | integer, string, time, decimal, bool, object, list, keyset, or guard | The second value to compare |

## Prerequisites

N/A

## Return values

The `!=` function returns a boolean value. In `Pact` language, it evaluates to `true` if the two arguments provided do not match and `false` if they do match. This functionality is used for comparison in conditional statements or assertions throughout the code. Specifically, this allows for functions to react dynamically based on the inequality of two values.

## Examples

```pact
(!= "hello" "goodbye")
```
This example checks if the two strings "hello" and "goodbye" are not equal. Since they are not identical, the function returns `true`.

```pact
(!= 5 10)
```
This example checks if the two integers 5 and 10 are not equal. Since they are different, the function returns `true`.

```pact
(!= true false)
```
This example checks if the two boolean values `true` and `false` are not equal. Since they are different, the function returns `true`.

```pact
(enforce (!= sender receiver) "sender and receiver cannot be the same")
```
In this real-world use case, the function is used to enforce that the `sender` and `receiver` are not the same in a transfer operation. If they are the same, the function throws an error with the message "sender and receiver cannot be the same".

```pact
(enforce (!= "" target-chain) "empty target-chain")
```
In this use case, the function checks if the `target-chain` is not an empty string. If it's an empty string, the function throws an error with the message "empty target-chain".

## Options

N/A

## Property validation

For property checking, the `!=` operator can be used when specifying an invariant or a property to test your code against a desired condition. The `!=` operator compares the inequality of the two operands.

It's often used to enforce certain conditions in code. For instance, it can be used to ensure that two given entities, such as `sender` and `receiver` in a transfer operation, are not equal to prevent operations such as self-transfers. Similarly, it can be used to ensure that a given value or variable is not equal to an empty string, thereby ensuring that it has a valid value.

If these conditions are not met, an error would be returned, specifying the nature of the validation failure. For instance, if a transfer operation is attempted where the `sender` and `receiver` are the same, an error message "sender cannot be the receiver of a transfer" would be returned.

Here is an example of how the `!=` operator is used for property validation:

```pact
(property (!= sender receiver)) 
```

In the example above, the `!=` operator is used to ensure that the `sender` and `receiver` are not the same. If they are, the operation will not proceed, hence maintaining the integrity and correctness of the data.

## Gotchas

The `!=` operator in Pact may return unexpected results when comparing data of different types. For example, comparing an integer to a string might not throw an error but will result in logical incongruity. As it is a strict inequality comparison operation, it strictly compares both value and data type. Always ensure that the data types of the values you're comparing are compatible and are what you expect them to be to avoid unexpected behavior.
