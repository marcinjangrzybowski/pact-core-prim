# hash

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## 
In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

## 
If your function needs any prerequisites to run successfully, describe them here. If there are no prerequisites, respond with 'N/A'.

## Return values

The `hash` function returns a string which is the computed BLAKE2b 256-bit hash of the input value. This can be used to create a consistent, unique hash identifier, for data verification or record checking. The hash is represented in an unpadded base64-url string format. If the function is unable to process the input or the hash can't be generated, it will return null or an error message.

## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## Gotchas

For the `hash` function in Pact, the following points need consideration:

- Please note that `hash` function relies on the BLAKE2b 256-bit hashing algorithm. Although extremely secure, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the workings and intricacies associated with this algorithm to avoid unexpected behavior.

- For non-string arguments, `hash` uses the JSON representation of the value for generating the hash. Therefore, changes in the JSON representation (ordering of keys, whitespace, etc) could result in different hash values.

- The return type of `hash` is always a string. If you require the hash value in a different format, you will need to handle that conversion in your code.

- Hashing is a one-way function meaning that the original value cannot be recovered from the hash. Therefore, the `hash` function should not be used if you need to recover the original value. 

- In some versions of pact, `hash` is only allowed to hash a boolean value. Attempting to hash other data types will result in an error. 

- The hash generated is specific to the input. Even a small change in the input would result in a completely different output hash. Be certain of your input values when comparing hashes or looking for matches.

Please ensure to test your code thoroughly while making use of the `hash` function.
