# ~

## Basic syntax

To use the `~` function in Pact, you need to input an integer value as an argument. The syntax is quite simple and straightforward. Here is how you do it:

```pact
(~ integer)
```

This above code will take the integer you put in as an argument and return its bit-reversed representation. Here's an example usage:

```pact
(~ 15)
```

This will return `-16`, which is the bit-reversal of `15`.
  
Please note, the `~` function only accepts integers as valid arguments; any other data type will result in an error.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | integer | The input integer whose bits you want to reverse using the `~` function. |

## Prerequisites

N/A

## Return values

The `~` function returns an integer after reversing all bits of the input integer `x`. The return value represents the corresponding integer value from the reversal of the binary representation of `x`. This operation can be useful in situations that require bit manipulation, bitwise comparisons, or low-level data processing.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate the usage of the `~` function in reversing all bits in an integer:

```pact
(~ 15)
-16
```

The `~` bitwise NOT operator inverts the bits of its operand. In the example above, the integer 15 (represented as 1111 in binary) is passed to the `~` function. The resultant inverted binary representation is 0000, which corresponds to -16 in two's complement representation.

Here's another example:

```pact
(~ 0)
-1
```

The `~` function inverts the binary representation of zero (which is also 0) to return -1.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## Gotchas

One key aspect to remember when using the `~` function in Pact is that it performs a bitwise NOT operation on the given integer, flipping all of its bits. This can often result in surprising or seemingly unintuitive results, especially when used with positive integers. For instance, applying `~` to 15 results in -16, as all bits in the binary representation of 15 (1111 in binary) are flipped to 0, and the leading bit indicates it's a negative number in two's complement representation. 

Be careful when expecting the result to be a positive integer, as applying `~` on any non-zero integer always yields a negative number due to the flipping of the sign bit in the two's complement representation used by computers. 

Also, please be aware that bitwise operations such as `~` can be quite low-level and might not be needed for most common use cases. They are typically used for optimizing certain computations, manipulating individual bits in more complex data structures, or interacting with hardware or other lower-level systems.
