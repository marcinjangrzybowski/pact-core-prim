# create-capability-pact-guard

## Basic syntax

The `create-capability-pact-guard` function is used to create a guard that validates if the defined capability is acquired and if the currently executing defpact is operational. Here is the basic syntax:

```pact
(create-capability-pact-guard *capability*:bool)
```

In this syntax, *capability* is a function which returns boolean value. When applied, it enforces that the corresponding capability is acquired and that the currently-executing defpact is operational.

Here is an example of its usage:

```pact
(create-capability-pact-guard (ESCROW owner))
```

This example enforces that the ESCROW existing on the current defpact's owner has been acquired and is operational.


## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CAPABILITY | bool | The capabilities and conditions that must be acquired and met for the currently executing defpact to be operational. |

## Prerequisites

Before you can use `create-capability-pact-guard`, the capability must be already defined in your code. The function expects the `capability` to be of type boolean. Also, this function should be used when a pact is currently executing. This means that you should have a defpact operational.

## Return values

The `create-capability-pact-guard` function returns a guard. This guard ensures that the capability is acquired and that the currently executing defpact is operational. The return value is primarily used to enforce certain conditions in a smart contract, thereby enhancing its security. If these conditions are not met, the execution of the contract can be halted.

## Examples

## Examples

The `create-capability-pact-guard` function is used to create a guard that enforces that the defined capability is acquired and the currently executing defpact is operational. 

Here is a simple example:

```pact
(create-capability-pact-guard (ESCROW owner))
```

In this example, the function creates a pact guard for the ability to "ESCROW" for the "owner". 

Remember to include the required capability as a lamba function. This function can be of any valid capability that returns a boolean value.

## Options

N/A

## Property validation

N/A

## Gotchas

While using the `create-capability-pact-guard` function, developers must be aware of a few important details to avoid unexpected issues:

- The function assumes that the capability has already been acquired and should be operational. Using it without these prerequisites might result in an error.
- The function should be used within a defpact execution, because it checks for the operational status of the currently executing defpact.
- Be cautious with specifying the CAPABILITY, it should always be valid and properly defined. In case of invalid capability usage, the function will likely throw error.

It is important to understand these nuances to effectively use the `create-capability-pact-guard` function without unwanted surprises or possibly incorrect results.
