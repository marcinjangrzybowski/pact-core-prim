# create-capability-pact-guard

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

## Examples

The `create-capability-pact-guard` function is used to create a guard that ensures a specified capability is acquired and that the currently-executing defpact is operational. Here are some examples of its usage:

```pact
(create-capability-pact-guard (TRANSFER "Alice"))
```
The above example illustrates how to create a guard that ensures that the `TRANSFER` capability associated with the user "Alice" is acquired and that the currently-executing defpact is operational.

```pact
(create-capability-pact-guard (ESCROW "Bob"))
```
In this example, a guard is created that checks if the `ESCROW` capability for "Bob" is acquired and if the currently-executing defpact is operational. This is particularly useful for smart contracts involving escrowing of assets.

```pact
(create-capability-pact-guard (DEBIT "Charlie"))
```
This final example creates a guard which checks if the `DEBIT` capability specific to the user "Charlie" is acquired and that the currently-executing defpact is operational. This would be useful in financial transactions involving debit operations.

These examples illustrate the use of different capabilities (`TRANSFER`, `ESCROW`, `DEBIT`) along with different users ("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie") to showcase the flexibility and power of the `create-capability-pact-guard` function.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, discuss any unintuitive behavior, potential pitfalls, or common mistakes to avoid while using your function. Make sure to present this information in a clear and concise manner to help your users avoid these issues. If there are no known gotchas associated with your function, respond with 'N/A'.
