# describe-keyset

## Basic syntax

To get the metadata for a keyset, use the following syntax:

```pact
(describe-keyset *keyset*:string)
```

This function can only be used at the top level and will fail if used in module code. The argument for this function is a string that specifies the keyset you want to retrieve metadata for.

Please note that the use of `describe-keyset` should be limited as it might lead to code that is more difficult to understand and maintain. It's highly recommended to manage keysets using Pact's built-in keyset management capabilities wherever possible.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| keyset | string | Specifies the keyset for which you want to retrieve the metadata. This function will fail if used in module code. |

## Prerequisites

N/A

## Return values

The `describe-keyset` function returns an object that contains metadata for the specified keyset. The returned metadata provides detailed information about the keyset which may include its properties and values. This return value is useful in scenarios where an understanding of the keyset's structure and attributes is needed to manipulate or validate keyset data. Note that the function will fail if used in module code and must only be employed at the top level.

## Examples

```pact
(describe-keyset "admin-keyset")
```

The example above retrieves the metadata for the "admin-keyset". However, remember that this function only runs at the top level and will fail if used in module code. The output will be an object representing the metadata of the specified keyset.

```pact
(describe-keyset "user-keyset")
```

The example above retrieves the metadata for the "user-keyset". Consider the nature of the keyset you are trying to describe and ensure that it is being used appropriately in your application context.

Please, note that the function `describe-keyset` does not modify the state of the keyset it describes, it only fetches and displays its associated metadata.

## Options

## Property validation

## Gotchas

The main gotcha for `describe-keyset` is in regard to the function's execution context. `describe-keyset` is meant to be used at the top level only and will fail if used in module code. This limitation might be confusing for users who attempt to call `describe-keyset` within a module scope. Always ensure that you use `describe-keyset` at the right context to get the expected output.
