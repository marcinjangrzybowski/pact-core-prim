# enumerate

## Basic syntax

To generate a sequence of numbers from a given range, you can use the `enumerate` function in Pact with the following syntax:

```pact
(enumerate *from*:integer *to*:integer)
```

Where,
- `from`: Specifies the start of the range.
- `to`: Specifies the end of the range.

The function will produce a list of integers from `from` to `to`, incrementing by 1.

```pact
(enumerate 0 4)
```
Outputs:

```pact
[0 1 2 3 4]
```

`enumerate` can also be used with an additional argument for different increments as follows:

```pact
(enumerate *from*:integer *to*:integer *inc*:integer)
```

Where,
- `from`: Specifies the start of the range.
- `to`: Specifies the end of the range.
- `inc`: Specifies the increment between each number in the sequence.

Here is an example usage:

```pact
(enumerate 0 10 2)
```
Outputs:

```pact
[0 2 4 6 8 10]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| from | integer | Specifies the starting number of the sequence.|
| to | integer | Specifies the ending number of the sequence. Both the starting and ending numbers are inclusive in the sequence.|
| inc (optional) | integer | Specifies the increment between numbers in the sequence. If this argument is not provided, the default increment value is 1. The increment value can also be negative, which indicates decrement. If inc results in a sequence that cannot reach the "to" value, or inc = 0, a singleton list containing "from" is returned. |

## Prerequisites

For the `enumerate` function to run successfully, the user must ensure that the input parameters adhere to the following conditions:
1) The `from` and `to` arguments must both be integers and are inclusive.
2) The `inc` argument should also be an integer and determines the increment between numbers in the sequence.
If `inc` is not provided, it is assumed to be 1.
If `from` is greater than `to` and `inc` is not given, the `inc` is assumed to be -1.
If `from` equals `to`, the function returns a list with the single element `from` irrespective of `inc`'s value.
3) In case `inc` is equal to zero, the function will return a list with the single element `from`.
4) If `inc` is structured such that `from + inc` is not inside the `from` and `to` interval, the function will return a list with the single element `from`. If `inc` is structured such that `from + inc` is outside the `from` and `to` interval, the function fails. 

Additionally, it's crucial to understand that the typical usage of this function within the program is in the generation of a sequence of numbers as a list. This sequence is often subsequently passed to another function for further operations, as seen in the provided code snippets. 

Please also be mindful of the data type returned by the `enumerate` function. As indicated in the legacy documentation, it produces an integer in a list structure. This output should be compatible with the subsequent functions that utilize this output.

## Return values

The `enumerate` function returns a list of integers. In essence, it generates a sequence of numbers, starting from the first input parameter ('from') up to the second input parameter ('to'), incrementing by the value of the third parameter ('step'). If the 'step' is not provided, the function assumes a default increment value of 1, or -1 if 'from' is greater than 'to'. The returned sequence can be useful in a variety of contexts where generating a range of numbers is required, such as creating iterative loops, generating a series of IDs, or validating a set of sequential inputs.

## Examples

The `enumerate` function can be used in several ways depending on the arguments provided. This function is used for generating sequences of numbers within a specific range and increment.

Below are some examples:

```pact
(enumerate 0 10 2)
```
This example enumerates from 0 to 10 inclusive with an increment of 2. It returns `[0 2 4 6 8 10]`.

```pact
(enumerate 0 10)
```
This example enumerates from 0 to 10 inclusive with a default increment of 1, hence returns `[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]`.

```pact
(enumerate 10 0)
```
In this example, enumeration goes from 10 to 0. Since no increment is provided and the `from` is greater than `to`, it assumes an increment of -1, hence it returns `[10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0]`.

The `enumerate` function can also be used with the `map` function to manipulate the resulting list, as shown in the following code snippet retrieved from the repositories:
```pact
(defconst VALID_CHAIN_IDS (map (int-to-str 10) (enumerate 0 19)))
```
This example generates a list of numbers from 0 to 19 and then converts each number to a string.

## Options

N/A

## Property validation

The `enumerate` function can be used for property validation for certain conditions in your code. You can use it to check if a particular value appears in a specified range. For example, if you want to ensure that a certain function only operates on integers from 0 to 19, you can express this property check as follows:

```pact
(defproperty valid-chain-id
  (property (member chain-id (map (int-to-str 10) (enumerate 0 19))))
)
```

In this example, the `enumerate` function is used in a property contract to check if a given `chain-id` is part of the valid Chainweb chain ids. The `enumerate` function here generates a list of integers from 0 to 19 which is then converted to strings using `map`. If the `chain-id` is not in the generated list, the property check will fail and the function will not execute.

## Gotchas

When using the `enumerate` function, please keep in mind the following key points:

- When `from` is greater than `to` and `inc` is not provided, the `enumerate` function assumes a decrement of `-1`. This might be unexpected if, for instance, you are trying to create an empty list when `from` is greater than `to`.

- The function return the singleton list containing `from` in several scenarios: 
  - If `from` equals `to`
  - If `inc` is equal to `0`, regardless of `from` and `to` values
  - If `inc` is such that `from + inc > to` (when `from < to`) or `from + inc < to` (when `from > to`).
  
- Use of incorrect value for `inc` can lead the function to fail. The function would fail if `inc` is such that `from + inc < to` (when `from < to`) or `from + inc > to` (when `from > to`).

- Like any list functions, `enumerate` could significantly consume memory when producing large lists. Always consider the capacity and requirements of your context.
