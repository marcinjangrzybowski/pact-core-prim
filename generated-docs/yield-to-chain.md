# yield-to-chain

## Basic syntax

The `yield-to-chain` function is utilized to implement side effects of a transaction simultaneously on more than one chain system.

Here is the basic syntax pattern for `yield-to-chain`:

```pact
(yield-to-chain chainId:string name:string input:any)
```

In its basic form, you call `yield-to-chain` with a chain ID, which is a string that identifies the target chain, a name (also a string) which refers to the target function on the external chain, along with an input of any valid pact datatype that serves as an argument for the target function.

Remember that all simultaneous transactions must declare consensus. The `yield-to-chain` function calls are distributed to all the peers in the pact network and are persisted only if all peers reach consensus.

In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

If your function needs any prerequisites to run successfully, describe them here. If there are no prerequisites, respond with 'N/A'.

In this section, detail what your function returns. Describe the type and purpose of the returned value, and explain in what context this return value would be useful. 

Remember, this section should not be left empty - if the function does not return anything, clearly state that this is the case.

## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, discuss any unintuitive behavior, potential pitfalls, or common mistakes to avoid while using your function. Make sure to present this information in a clear and concise manner to help your users avoid these issues. If there are no known gotchas associated with your function, respond with 'N/A'.
