# zip

## Basic syntax

The `zip` function in Pact combines two lists into a new one using a specified function `f`. The length of the output list would be the length of the shorter input list. The function `f` must be a binary function taking two inputs of any type.

Here's the basic syntax of the `zip` function:

```pact
(zip *f* list1 list2)
```

Where:

- `*f*` is a function that takes two arguments: one element from each list.
- `list1` and `list2` are the lists to be combined. They don't have to be of the same length, and their elements can be of any type.

The following code snippet is an example of `zip` usage:

```pact
(zip (+) [1 2 3 4] [4 5 6 7])
```

In the example above, the binary function `(+)` is applied onto the pair of elements from the two lists, finally giving out a new list as a result. The length of the resulting list is equal to the length of the shorter input list.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| f | function | The function to apply to corresponding elements from the two lists, in the form `x:<a> y:<b> -> <c>`. This function specifies how to combine corresponding elements from the two lists. |
| list1 | list | The first list of elements, in the form `[<a>]`, to combine using function `f`. |
| list2 | list | The second list of elements, in the form `[<b>]`, to combine using function `f`. The function zips until the shorter of two lists ends.|

## Prerequisites

## Return values

The `zip` function returns a new list. The elements of this list are the result of the function `f` applied to corresponding elements from the input lists. The returned list has length equal to the shortest input list. If one or both input lists are empty, `zip` will return an empty list. This return value is useful when you need to combine two lists element by element using some operation.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `zip` function:

```pact
(zip (+) [1 2 3 4] [4 5 6 7])
```
This will return `[5 7 9 11]`, because the + operation is applied to each corresponding pair of elements from the two lists.

```pact
(zip (-) [1 2 3 4] [4 5 6])
```
In this case, we've used the - operation and the second list has fewer elements than the first one. This results in `[-3 -3 -3]` as the `zip` function will only iterate over the shortest list.

```pact
(zip (+) [1 2 3] [4 5 6 7])
```
Here, the + operation is used again but this time the first list is shorter, giving a result of `[5 7 9]`.

```pact
(zip (lambda (x y) { 'x: x, 'y: y }) [1 2 3 4] [4 5 6 7])
```
In this example, a lambda function is used to create an object for each corresponding pair of elements in the lists. The function will create a new object with 'x' and 'y' keys with their corresponding values. This results in `[{"x": 1,"y": 4} {"x": 2,"y": 5} {"x": 3,"y": 6} {"x": 4,"y": 7}]`.

## Gotchas

1. `zip` operates on two lists and will return a new list with the length of the shortest list. This means if one of your lists is longer than the other, the remaining elements in the longer list won't be considered in the `zip` operation.

2. The function provided to `zip` should be able to handle all elements from both lists. If the function can't process some elements, you'll run into run-time errors. 

3. The function provided to `zip` must take exactly two arguments - the function would not work as intended if single or multiple arguments are introduced. 

4. Make sure both lists passed to `zip` must have the same data types if the operation function requires the same type of inputs. Example: If the operation function is numerical addition, and one of the list has non-numerical elements, it would result a run-time error.
