# mod

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | integer | The dividend in the modulus operation, or the number to be divided. |
| y | integer | The divisor in the modulus operation, or the number by which 'x' is divided. |

## Return values

The `mod` function returns an integer that represents the remainder of the division of the first argument by the second argument. This return value can be especially useful in programming when you want to achieve wrap-around behavior (e.g., in cycling through an array) or when you want to impose a periodicity (e.g., with weekly events that always fall on the same day of the week).

## Examples

```pact
(mod 13 8)
5
```

In this example, we use the mod function to find the remainder of 13 divided by 8. The remainder is 5.

```pact
(mod 10 3)
1
```

This example demonstrates finding the remainder of 10 divided by 3. The result is 1.

```pact
(mod 16 4)
0
```

This example shows that when 16 is divided by 4, the remainder is 0. 

Remember, the 'mod' function should always be supported in invariants or properties.

## Property validation

The `mod` function does not contain built-in property validation as it doesn't conduct any checks on its inputs beyond type checking ensured by Pact's strong type system. If the inputs are integers as required, the function will execute and return a result. Its behavior with corner cases can be easily inferred:

- If the dividend (first argument) is zero, the function will always return 0 regardless of the divisor (second argument), as zero divided by any number gives 0.
- If the divisor (second argument) is zero, the function will fail with an arithmetic error, as division by zero is not defined.

Therefore, it's recommended to ensure the inputs uphold these conditions before calling `mod`.

## Gotchas

While the `mod` function generally behaves as expected, there are a few edge cases to keep in mind: 

- Division by 0: In many programming languages, an error is thrown when trying to divide by zero. In Pact, this is also the case. If the second argument to `mod` is 0, the function will throw an error.

- Negative numbers: The `mod` function also works with negative numbers. However, the result could be counter-intuitive. When the first argument is negative, the result will be negative. When the second argument is negative, the result depends on the implementation, and some versions of Pact might throw an error. 

- Non-integer input: The `mod` function expects both of its arguments to be integers. If either argument is a non-integer value, the function will throw an error. 

In order to avoid these potential issues, ensure that the divisor (second argument) of `mod` is never zero, avoid using negative integers unless you are sure of the result, and always provide integer arguments to `mod`.
