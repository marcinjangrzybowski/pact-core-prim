# make-list

## Basic syntax

The basic syntax for `make-list` is as follows:

```pact
(make-list *length*:integer *value*)
```

This function takes two arguments:

* `length` is an integer representing the number of times the specified `value` is repeated in the resulting list.
* `value` is the object that will be repeated in the list.

Here is an example usage of `make-list`:

```pact
(make-list 4 "foo")
```

This will produce a list with 4 instances of the string "foo" - `["foo", "foo", "foo", "foo"]`. You can use any data type as the `value` to be repeated.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| n | integer | This parameter specifies the length of the list to be created. |
| a | any data type | This is the value which is repeated n times to create the list. |

## Prerequisites

N/A

## Return values

The `make-list` function returns a new list with `n` copies of `a`. The return type can be any list type depending on the type of `a`. This function is useful when you need to generate a list with repeated elements of a given length. For example, if `n` is 5 and `a` is true, then the function will return a list `[true, true, true, true, true]`. If `n` is 3 and `a` is "blue", then the function will return a list `["blue", "blue", "blue"]`. The length of the returned list will always be equal to the integer value specified for `n`. If `n` is 0 or a negative number, the function will return an empty list.

## Examples

The `make-list` function is used to create a new list by repeating a specific value a certain number of times. Below are examples demonstrating the usage of this function. 

This example creates a list of 5 boolean values - `true`.

```pact
(make-list 5 true)
```
Output:

```pact
[true true true true true]
```

This example creates a list of 3 integers - `10`.

```pact
(make-list 3 10)
```
Output:

```pact
[10 10 10]
```

This example creates a list of 4 strings - "example".

```pact
(make-list 4 "example")
```
Output:

```pact
["example" "example" "example" "example"]
```

These examples can be included in property validation checks using the `make-list` function to create expected output lists for invariant or property testing.

## Options

N/A

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## Gotchas

The `make-list` function creates a list by repeating the given value. Be careful to not assume that it will create a list with unique values. If a mutable type is given, like a list or an object, the same instance will be referenced in every position of the list - not unique copies of the value.

For example:

```pact
(make-list 3 [1 2 3])
[[1 2 3] [1 2 3] [1 2 3]]
```

The list `[1 2 3]` is repeated in every position. But, it's the same list being referenced, not unique copies.

Also, remember that `make-list` for zero or negative lengths will produce an empty list irrespective of the value, not a list with the value.

```pact
(make-list -5 true)
[]
```
Here, even though `true` is provided as value, the result is an empty list because the length is negative. Always ensure that the length argument is positive and greater than zero to get a list of the specified length.
