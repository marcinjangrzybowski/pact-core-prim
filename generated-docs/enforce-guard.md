# enforce-guard

## Basic syntax

The `enforce-guard` has two main forms, which applies a guard, or applies the named keyset with the specified name. The basic syntax is as follows:

To apply a guard, use the following syntax:

```pact
(enforce-guard guard:guard)
```

To apply a named keyset, use the following syntax:

```pact
(enforce-guard keysetname:string)
```

This function throws an error if the guard predicate fails. You can see its usage in the following examples:

```pact
(enforce-guard 'admin-keyset)
(enforce-guard row-guard)
```

Here, `admin-keyset` and `row-guard` are example keyset names to use in your guard. Replace these with your own keyset names.

In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact

'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.
