# create-capability-guard

## Basic syntax

To create a capability guard, use the following syntax:

```pact
(create-capability-guard *capability*: bool)
```

This function takes one argument, a boolean expression representing a capability. 

For example:

```pact
(create-capability-guard (BANK_DEBIT 10.0))
```

In this example, `(BANK_DEBIT 10.0)` is a capability which represents the debit operation from a bank account with the transaction amount being 10.0. The `create-capability-guard` function creates a guard ensuring that this capability is invoked for any subsequent transactions.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| capability | bool | A boolean expression or a capability that needs to be acquired for the guard to pass. |

## Prerequisites

Before using the `create-capability-guard` function, ensure that the CAPABILITY you want to enforce is defined in your code. This capability is the action that your code is permitted to perform when the guard condition is met. This CAPABILITY is specified as a predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) in the argument of `create-capability-guard`.

## Return values

The `create-capability-guard` function returns a guard. The returned guard ensures that the specified capability is acquired. This can be useful in contexts where you want to enforce that certain capabilities must be obtained before proceeding with specific operations or transactions.

## Examples

Below are some examples of how to use the `create-capability-guard` function:

1. Using `create-capability-guard` for guard creation with a capability:

```pact
(define-capability BANK_DEBIT (amount:decimal))
(enforce-guard (create-capability-guard BANK_DEBIT))
```

In this example, the `create-capability-guard` function creates a guard that ensures the `BANK_DEBIT` capability is acquired.

2. Usage of `create-capability-guard` within a function:

```pact
(defun withdraw
  ( amount:decimal )
  (with-capability (BANK_DEBIT amount) 
    (enforce-guard (create-capability-guard BANK_DEBIT)) 
    (debit-from-account amount)) )
)
```
In this case, `create-capability-guard` is used within the `withdraw` function to enforce the `BANK_DEBIT` capability. 

Note: The above examples assume that the capability and functions like `debit-from-account` are already defined.
