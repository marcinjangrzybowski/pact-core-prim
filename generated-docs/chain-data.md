# chain-data

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## 
In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

## 
If your function needs any prerequisites to run successfully, describe them here. If there are no prerequisites, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, detail what your function returns. Describe the type and purpose of the returned value, and explain in what context this return value would be useful. 

Remember, this section should not be left empty - if the function does not return anything, clearly state that this is the case.

## Examples

```pact
(chain-data)
```
The above example use the `chain-data` function without any argument (as it does not take any). The `chain-data` function retrieves blockchain-specific information and metadata.

The `chain-data` function can function along with other constructs, for instance like `at` in below example.
```pact
(at 'chain-id (chain-data))
```
This will give the chain ID, which is part of the blockchain metadata.

And in this example function `chain-data` is used to enforce rules in a transaction:
```pact
(enforce (!= (at 'chain-id (chain-data)) target-chain)
  "cannot run cross-chain transfers to the same chain")
```
This enforces that the current chain's ID (retrieved by `chain-data`) is not the same as `target-chain`, avoiding execution of a cross-chain transaction within the same chain.

These examples illustrate how the `chain-data` function can be used to retrieve information and apply business rules when developing blockchain applications.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, discuss any unintuitive behavior, potential pitfalls, or common mistakes to avoid while using your function. Make sure to present this information in a clear and concise manner to help your users avoid these issues. If there are no known gotchas associated with your function, respond with 'N/A'.
