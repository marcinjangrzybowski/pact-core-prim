Use `-` operator to perform the subtraction operation in Pact. If it is used with one argument, it returns the negative of the argument. If it is used with two arguments, it returns the difference of the two arguments.

## Basic syntax

To perform the negation operation, use the following syntax:

```pact
(- *value*:number)
```

To perform the subtraction operation, use the following syntax:

```pact
(- *minuend*:number *subtrahend*:number)
```

The `*value*`, `*minuend*`, and `*subtrahend*` are placeholders for any numbers. 

Note: `*minuend*` is the number from which another number (`*subtrahend*`) will be subtracted.

## Examples

The following example returns the negative of the given number:

```pact
(- 10)
-10
```

The following example returns the difference of the two numbers:

```pact
(- 10 4)
6
```

## Arguments 

The `-` function in Pact takes two arguments: 

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a | integer, decimal | The minuend, that is, the number from which another number (the Subtrahend) is to be subtracted. |
| b | integer, decimal | The subtrahend, that is, the number which is to be subtracted from another number (the Minuend). |

## Return values

The `-` function in Pact language returns the result of subtraction of two numbers. Specifically, it subtracts the second number from the first one. The returned value is of type `decimal` or `integer`, depending on the input. This function may be useful in scenarios where a calculation involving subtraction is required. If the function is used with non-numeric arguments, it will return an error.

Here are few code examples demonstrating the use of the `-` function in pact. 

## Examples

Example 1: Subtract two integers

```pact
(- 5 3)
2
```

Example 2: Subtract decimal numbers

```pact
(- 10.5 2.5)
8.0
```

Example 3: Subtract variable values

```pact
(let ((x 10) (y 2))
  (- x y))
8
```

When subtracting variable values, you'll need to define the variables using let in the scope where the subtraction is performed.

These examples should demonstrate clear use of the `-` function. Please ensure that you have understood the function correctly before using it in your code.

The `-` function does not have any configurable options in its operation. Hence, the 'Options' section is not applicable.

## Property validation

The `-` (_subtraction operator_) applies a standard numeric input validation. It expects two numeric values and fails if any of the inputs are non-numeric. The function also supports implicit conversion, meaning that if strings containing valid numbers are used as inputs, they will be converted and the operation will be performed. However, other data types cannot be converted and will result in a failure.

Moreover, the `-` operator implements a standard math rules validation. Specifically, it checks for issues such as subtracting a larger number from a smaller one, which may lead to negative numbers.

Error messages will be returned for any validation failures, making it easy to identify and correct the issue.
