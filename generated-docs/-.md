## Prerequisites

## Return values

The `-` function returns a number that is the result of subtracting the second operand from the first operand. The function handles both integers and decimals. Use this function to perform subtraction operations in your code. If used with non-numerical arguments or if the second operand is not smaller or equal to the first operand, it may throw an error or provide an unexpected output.

## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.
