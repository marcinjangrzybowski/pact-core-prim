# with-default-read

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| table | `table:<{row}>` | The database table to perform the read operation on. |
| key | `string` | The key identifying the row from where the data will be fetched. |
| defaults | `object:~<{row}>` | An object containing default values that will be used if the row is not found in the table. The object keys should match the column names in the `table`. |
| bindings | `binding:~<{row}>` | A set of bindings that assign the values read from the row (or the default object if the row is not found) to identifiers. After using `with-default-read`, these identifiers will be available in subsequent expressions in the body of the `with-default-read` function. |

## 
If your function needs any prerequisites to run successfully, describe them here. If there are no prerequisites, respond with 'N/A'.

## Return values

The `with-default-read` function doesn't explicitly return a value. However, it implicates a return through its body statements that are executed after the read operation. 

This function is primarily used as a control flow mechanism to retrieve a specified row from the table and bind columns. If the row is not found, the function uses the provided defaults object to bind the columns. After binding, subsequent body statements within the function scheme are executed. 

The implicit 'return' would be the end result from these executed subsequent statements, and the usage and type of this may differ based on individual usage context. 

For instance, in the function's example usage: `(with-default-read accounts id { "balance": 0, "ccy": "USD" } { "balance":= bal, "ccy":= ccy } (format "Balance for {} is {} {}" [id bal ccy]))`, the function indirectly returns a string that represents an account balance, formatted using binding results retrieved from the table or defaults object. 

Thus, the return value is determined by the subsequent body statements inside the `with-default-read` function scheme. Understanding what the function returns almost always requires a view into these subsequent statements.


## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
In this section, discuss any unintuitive behavior, potential pitfalls, or common mistakes to avoid while using your function. Make sure to present this information in a clear and concise manner to help your users avoid these issues. If there are no known gotchas associated with your function, respond with 'N/A'.
