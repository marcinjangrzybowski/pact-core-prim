# reverse

## Basic syntax

The `reverse` function is used to reorder the elements of a list in reverse order. Here is the basic syntax:

```pact
(reverse [list])
```

The argument for the `reverse` function is a list, represented as `[list]`, and it returns a list with the elements in reverse order.

For example:

```pact
(reverse [1 2 3])
```

This will return: `[3 2 1]`.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xs | [a] | Specifies the list of values you want to reverse.|

## Prerequisites

N/A

## Return values

The `reverse` function returns a new list which is the reverse of the original list passed to it. The returned list contains the same elements but in the opposite order. The data types of elements in the returned list will be same as that in the original list. This returned value is useful when you need to operate on the list elements in the reverse order of their original sequence.

## Examples

```pact
(reverse [1 2 3])
[3 2 1]
```

In this example, the numbers in the array are reversed. The array `[1, 2, 3]` has been changed to `[3, 2, 1]`.

```pact
(reverse ["apple" "banana" "cherry"])
["cherry" "banana" "apple"]
```

Here, the string elements of the list are reversed. The list `["apple" "banana" "cherry"]` has been rearranged  into `["cherry" "banana" "apple"]`.

```pact 
(reverse [true false true false])
[false true false true]
```

In this case, the boolean values within the list are reversed. So, `[true false true false]` is transformed into `[false true false true]`.

## Options

N/A

## Property validation

For property validation, the `reverse` function can be used to test that a certain sequence or pattern is followed or met in the list. For instance, verifying that an enumerated list goes in descending order. If it's unclear whether the list follows the order, one could use the `reverse` function and validate starting from what should be the first element after reversal. This function doesn't check any properties of its arguments, and hence no error conditions pertaining to argument properties are raised.

## Gotchas

The `reverse` function has no identified gotchas or common pitfalls as per the previous documentation and code snippets provided. It behaves as expected by returning a reversed version of the given list. Please note though that `reverse` function only works on lists and attempting to use it on any other data type like strings or integers will result in an error. Always ensure input passed to the `reverse` function is a list.
