# diff-time

## 
Generate a clear and concise explanation of the basic syntax for your function. This section should contain at least one code snippet demonstrating how to use the function. The code should be provided in the format: 

'''pact
your function syntax
'''

If your function can be overloaded, provide additional code snippets to reflect its multiple uses. Overall, aim to describe the syntax in a way that is easy to comprehend, including any necessary arguments and acceptable data types.

## 
In this section, provide a detailed explanation of all the arguments of your function. Create a markdown table with each row representing a different argument. Your table should include the following fields:

| Argument | Type | Description |

Make sure the 'Argument' field contains the name of the argument, 'Type' lists the data type of the argument, and 'Description' holds a clear, concise explanation of what the argument means in the context of your function. 

Ensure the number of rows in your table matches the arity of your function.

## Prerequisites

N/A

## 
In this section, detail what your function returns. Describe the type and purpose of the returned value, and explain in what context this return value would be useful. 

Remember, this section should not be left empty - if the function does not return anything, clearly state that this is the case.

## 
Provide few code examples demonstrating the use of your function. Each example should be contained within the markdown code block: 

'''pact
your function usage example
'''

The examples should be clear and easy to understand. They should demonstrate the use of different arguments or use cases where applicable.

## 
If your function has any configurable options, describe them here in the format similar to the 'Arguments'. That is, a markdown table with 'Option', 'Type' and 'Description' as columns. Make sure to clearly explain the effect of each option on your function's execution. If there are no options, respond with 'N/A'.

## 
If your function includes any form of property validation, explain it here. Clearly explain the rules that the function follows to verify its arguments and error conditions. If there is no property validation involved in your function, respond with 'N/A'.

## Gotchas

1. Please remember that the `diff-time` function calculates the difference in seconds. Ensure your calculations take this into consideration, especially when working with dates and times across different timezones.

2. `diff-time` function follows the subtractive order of TIME1 - TIME2. If TIME1 is smaller than TIME2, the returned result will be a negative number. This might not be what you expect, always ensure TIME1 is greater than TIME2 if you want a positive result.

3. The `diff-time` function is only supported in properties, therefore its usage outside of properties will result in an error.

4. `diff-time` function will throw an error if any of the arguments are not of `time` type. Always validate your inputs before using them.

5. Be aware that due to the nature of floating point numbers, the result may not always be exact. When precision is critical, consider other ways to calculate time difference.
