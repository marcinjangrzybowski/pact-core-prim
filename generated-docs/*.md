## Basic syntax

The multiplication function `*` takes two arguments of numeric types and returns their product. Both arguments should be of the same type, either both integers or both decimals.

To use the multiplication function, enter two numbers separated by the `*` operator in Pact format as shown below:

```pact
(* x y)
```

Where `x` and `y` are either `integer` or `decimal` values.

An example usage of the `*` function with integers would be:

```pact
(* 2 3)
```

This will return `6`.

An example usage of the `*` function with decimals would be:

```pact
(* 2.5 3.5)
```

This will return `8.75`.


The function can also be used with variables that hold integer or decimal values. For example:

```pact
(let ((a 2) (b 3)) (* a b))
```

This will return `6`.

Please note, mixing integers with decimals in the multiplication will result in an error. Both arguments should be of the same type.

## Arguments

The `*` function accepts two arguments. Both arguments must be of the same type, either an integer or a decimal. The function will then return the multiplication result of these two numbers.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x` | Integer/Decimal | The first factor of the multiplication. |
| `y` | Integer/Decimal | The second factor of the multiplication. |

## Return values

The `*` function returns the product of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are of type `integer`, the return type is `integer`. If either or both `x` and `y` are of type `decimal`, the return type is `decimal`. The returned value represents the multiplication result of the two inputs, which is useful in mathematical computations and various other contexts where multiplication of numbers is required.

# *

The `*` function is used to perform multiplication of integers and decimals in the Pact programming language.

## Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the `*` function:

Multiplication of two integers:
```pact
(* 6 7)
42
```

Multiplication of two decimals:
```pact
(* 3.5 2.0)
7.0
```

Multiplication of an integer and a decimal:
```pact
(* 3.5 2)
7.0
```

Multiplication in a mathematical expression:
```pact
(+ (* 3 5) 2)
17
```

Multiplication in a more complex expression:
```pact
(defschema schema1
  (fee:decimal))

(let*
  ((fee 2.5)
   (refund (- 20.0 (* fee 2))))
  refund)
15.0
```

## Property validation

The `*` function in Pact does perform property validation on its input arguments `x` and `y`. Specifically, both `x` and `y` must be of the same data type, either `integer` or `decimal`. If one argument is an `integer` and the other is a `decimal`, or vice versa, the `*` function will return an error.

This property enforcement makes sure that multiplication only occurs between numbers of the same type, preventing unexpected results or errors related to type mismatches. 

Should the function be used in an inappropriate context where the properties of input arguments are violated, the execution of the pact code will halt and return an error message. This makes the `*` function safe to use in any numeric calculations within your pact code.

Here is an example of potential error message: 
```pact
RUNTIME ERROR: TypeError: "Expected a number"
```

## Gotchas

One must remember that the `*`  function in Pact operates on `integer` or `decimal` types only. Providing any other type of value as an argument to this function will result in a type error at runtime.

Also, as Pact performs strict type checking, it does not implicitly convert input types. Therefore, when multiplying a decimal and an integer, it is necessary to convert the integer to a decimal manually using the `to-decimal` function.

Additionally, similar to other programming languages, multiplication in Pact respects the order of operations. Thus, in complex expressions, it might be necessary to use parentheses to ensure the desired precedence of the multiplication operation.
